## Abstract
Antibiotic resistance is increasingly widespread, largely due to human influence. Here, we explore the relationship between antibiotic resistance and the antimicrobial chemicals triclosan, triclocarban, and methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparaben in the dust microbiome. Dust samples from a mixed-use athletic and educational facility were subjected to microbial and chemical analyses using a combination of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenome sequencing, and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The dust resistome was characterized by identifying antibiotic resistance genes from the metagenomes of each sample using ShortBRED and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD). The three most highly abundant antibiotic resistance genes were tetW, SRT-1, and ermB. The complete dust resistome was then compared against the measured concentrations of antimicrobial chemicals. We uncovered several positive associations between the occurrence of antimicrobial chemicals and antibiotic resistance genes, including one between the ubiquitous antimicrobial triclosan and 23S ribosomal RNA methyltransferases implicated in resistance to several antibiotics. Results indicate that increased antibiotic resistance correlates with increased antimicrobial chemicals in the built environment. This study is the first to look for an association between antibiotic resistance genes and antimicrobial chemicals in dust.
